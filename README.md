Diabetes Prediction using Random Forest Classifier entails employing a machine learning algorithm known as Random Forest to forecast the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. This method utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to analyze various health-related features like blood sugar levels, BMI, age, etc., in order to make predictions. By aggregating the results from multiple decision trees, the Random Forest Classifier enhances prediction accuracy and robustness. It is a popular approach in predictive modeling due to its ability to handle complex datasets, mitigate overfitting, and provide insights into feature importance for diabetes risk assessment.
